# Liquid Glass Web

`liquid-glass-web.ts` adapts the refraction pipeline from
[xiaofangstudio/liquid-glass-web](https://github.com/xiaofangstudio/liquid-glass-web),
fixed at commit `3094add905e60ee5aeb45e806751beb94425dd73`.
Sources: `liquid-glass.js` and `showcase.html`. The upstream README declares MIT;
its original refraction engine is by [Shu Ding](https://github.com/shuding/liquid-glass).
License notices ship with the app in `public/third-party-licenses.txt`.

The integration uses the upstream smoothstep, rounded rectangle SDF and
canvas/SVG displacement pipeline. It replaces demo auto-start and floating drag
behaviour with a React lifecycle. Changes include aspect-aware geometry, bounded
raster resolution, signed displacement normalization, a named SVG map result,
size caching, explicit cleanup and a frosted fallback for unsupported/touch
environments. Optical filters only affect decorative surface backgrounds.
CSS provides restrained press/rebound and light effects without moving panels.

No CDN, remote image or runtime download is required. Update this commit and
recheck the browser/WebView2 rendering when changing the upstream implementation.
